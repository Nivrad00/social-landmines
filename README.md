# Forward
Forward is a visual novel intended to help adolescents re-enter school following hospitalization for suicide-related crises. By going through a simulated day in school, theyâ€™ll be able to practice navigating social landmines and managing their feelings in tense situations. Players will be confronted with situations of varying difficulty and shown a thermometer representing their psychological state as they make healthy or less healthy choices.

Ms. Martin: Okay, just let us know if you can think of anything!
Ms. Martin: We will dive right in. We're nearly done with this semester, so there is nothing we can do about changing classes. That means you'll have to make up missed work.
Ms. Martin: You'll need to go to each of your teachers and make a plan for completing the missed assignments.
Ms. Martin: We could make changes to your schedule for the next semester, though â€“- Mom, is that something you would like?
<<show mom neutral right>>
Mom: Yes, we'd like {$player} to take less challenging courses so {$they} can focus on recovering. 
Mom: Can you swap {$them} out of some of those courses?
Ms. Martin: Sure, we can change some courses. Maybe we can drop some of the extracurriculars, or offer a course that is more like a study hall.
Ms. Martin: What do you think about that, {$player}?
You think to yourself -- how do you feel about your classes being changed?

Ms. Martin: One thing that can help kids who have been out for a while is having a pass that allows them to come visit me when they are feeling overwhelmed.
